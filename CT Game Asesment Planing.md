## __Identifying the Need__
__Need__
To encrourage a more introspective view of the things that we are doing, letting things take time and enjoying the moment with no worries of the past or the future.
Inspiration from games like rain world, Ori and the will of the whisps, TOTK, hollow night, my freindly neighbor Totoro

__Problem Statement__
Within the gaming market there are very few games where you just wander, there is almost always a goal or objective to work towards and achieve, even within low
pressure cozy games such as stardew valley or animal crossing. I plan to create an experience where there is no goal, where you embody the flaneur from romantisism,
a wanderer who walks aimlessly.

__Skill Development__
Being a simple game in terms of mechanics I could probably use the tutorial that you privided us or ask my brother who is into gamedev and would know good recources
that I could watch on YouTube. I would have to develop skills in my sound design to achive the wanted feel of the game. I feel that I wouldn't need recources for the
visual and game design.

__Brainstorm__
cozy game
focus on sound design
wandering through areas

emerge from water
rain
leaf umbrella
dino
lizard
cat in bakery*

ends in feild of flowers just after rain stops
enjoyment of the silence once the game ends 
natural setting, rain forest, cave, field, 

|Game|Positive|Minus|Interesting|   
|---|---|---|---|
|Ori and the Will of the Wisps|The feeling and aesthetic of the world|The story|The player model|
|Rain World|The aesthetic and concept of being small in a very large world|hard, race against the clock|how it makes you feel so small|
|Zelda Tears of the Kingdom|The aimless quality of being able to enjoy the giant open world|dumb scaling|how the music makes you feel|
