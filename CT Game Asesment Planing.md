## __Identifying the Need__
__Need__  
To encrourage a more introspective view of the things that we are doing, letting things take time and enjoying the moment with no worries of the past or the future. Inspiration from games like rain world, Ori and the will of the whisps, TOTK, hollow night and my freindly neighbor Totoro

__Problem Statement__  
Within the gaming market there are very few games where you just wander, there is almost always a goal or objective to work towards and achieve, even within low pressure cozy games such as stardew valley or animal crossing. I plan to make a simple 2D platformer where the focus is on the atmosphere rather than game mechanicsand story. I want the game to feel very nice and polished.

__Skill Development__  
Being a simple game in terms of mechanics I could probably use the tutorial that you privided us or ask my brother who is into gamedev and would know good recources that I could watch on YouTube. I would have to develop skills in my sound design to achive the wanted feel of the game, and I would have to develop skills in game/level design.

__Brainstorm__  
cozy game  
focus on sound design  
wandering through areas  

emerge from water  
rain  
leaf umbrella  
dino  
lizard  
cat in bakery*  

ends in feild of flowers just after rain stops  
enjoyment of the silence once the game ends   
natural setting, rain forest, cave, field,   

|Game|Positive|Minus|Interesting|   
|---|---|---|---|
|Ori and the Will of the Wisps|The feeling and aesthetic of the world, movement|The story|The player model|
|Rain World|The aesthetic and concept of being small in a very large world|hard, race against the clock|how it makes you feel so small|
|Zelda Tears of the Kingdom|The feeling;s the world makes you feel|dumb scaling|epic music|

## __Requirements Outline__  

__Inputs:__ The only required inputs would be directional from the player  
__Proccessing:__ The game will check the players collision and position and if a step occured  
__Outputs:__ The game will show the scene and player model to the player aswell as the enviournmental, reactionary and maybe melodic sound  
__Transmision:__ This will be a single player, offline game  
__Storage:__ I will store the players levels completed and what level you are currently on locally  

### __Functional Requirements__  

__User Interaction__  
The user will use the directional keys on their keyboard (WASD + spacebar or arrows) and the mouse or a controller to move the character with two degrees of movement. The character will be able to move left and right and jump. The user will use their mouse to navigate menus in the game

__Core Gameplay or Simulation Mechanics__  
The only gameplay mechanics will be movement based, I will add normal 2d platformer movement like moving, jumping, walljumps and maybe a grappling mechanic. 

__Level Progresion__  
I am going to have the levels be small and enclosed and transision in a way simular to hollow knight where the two adjacent levels are loaded as to give a more seemless experience, there will be a trigger at the end of each level to track player level progress and which ones are completed.

__Saving and Loading Data__  
I will save a document that would contain information like which levels are completed and player controls.

### __Non-Functional Requirements__  

__Performance Requirements__  
I will aim for a stable framrate of at least 30fps, have the inputs feel instant with minimal delay and load the levels quickly or in a way that doesn't seem to take that long to the user, with a transition screen or something

__Usability Requirements__  
The game will inclue a simple at the start of the game to teach the user about the mechanics.

__Scalability__  
The game should be able to have extra levels in added in future and still maintain my performance requirements.

### __Considerations of Social and Ethical Issues__  

__Equity__ is recognizing that people do not have the same requirements and giving people the support that they need.  
__Accessability__ is ensuring that everyone can use a product, no matter how they find it
